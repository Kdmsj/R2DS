# **LexiLink: Exploring the Linguistic Connection Between Afan Oromo & Somali Languages**  

Welcome to **LexiLink**! This project is all about diving into the **textual and phonemic relationships** between the **Afan Oromo** and **Somali** languages. Using **Python**, it analyzes shared words, cleans and tokenizes text, removes stopwords, counts word frequencies, and converts graphemes to phonemes.



## **Why This Project?**  
Languages often share hidden patterns, especially those with historical and geographical ties. The goal of LexiLink is to explore these connections by:  
✔️ Identifying **common words** between Afan Oromo & Somali  
✔️ Analyzing their **phonemic structures**  
✔️ Understanding their **linguistic similarities** through data  

## 🛠 **How It Works**  
1. **Extract & Clean** text samples by tokenization, lemmatization and removal of stopwords
2. **Compare & Analyze** shared words and **Do** G2P conversion  
3. **Visualize** phoneme distributions  


## 🚀 **Getting Started**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Abe-Alefew/LexiLink.git
cd LexiLink
```
### **2. Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib

```
### 🔹 **Note:**  
- `re` and `collections` are **built-in Python modules**, so no installation is needed.  
- Ensure you have **Python installed** by running:  
  ```sh
  python --version
  ```
- It’s recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`) to keep dependencies organized.
  
### **3. Run the Analysis.**
```sh
python lexi_link.py
```

## 💡 **Who Can Use This?**  
Anyone interested in:  
🔹 **Linguistics & Computational Analysis**  
🔹 **Text Processing & NLP**  
🔹 **African Language Studies**  
🔹 **Phonetics & Language Comparisons**  

## Dependencies
### This project depends on the following libraries:

* collections
* numpy
* re
* matplotlib

## 🚀 Future Advancements  

- **Expand Language Coverage** – Add more Cushitic and Afro-Asiatic languages.  
- **AI & NLP Integration** – Use machine learning for better lexical similarity detection.  
- **Visualization & Analytics** – Build interactive dashboards for phonemic patterns.  
- **Efficiency & Optimization** – Improve processing speed with advanced phonetic algorithms.  
- **API & Open Source** – Develop an API and foster community-driven contributions.  

These enhancements will make **LexiLink** a powerful tool for linguistic research! 🚀
